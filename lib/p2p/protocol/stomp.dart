/// STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) implementation for libp2p.
///
/// This package provides a STOMP 1.2 protocol implementation that allows
/// libp2p peers to communicate using the STOMP messaging protocol.
///
/// STOMP is a simple interoperable protocol designed for asynchronous message
/// passing between clients via mediating servers. It defines a text based
/// wire-format for messages passed between these clients and servers.
///
/// This is an implementation of the STOMP 1.2 specification adapted for
/// libp2p peer-to-peer communication.
