# Reasoning Tree Documentation Method

## Purpose
This method allows systematic documentation of complex problem-solving processes while maintaining:
- Clear path tracking through the solution space
- Status of explored and unexplored reasoning branches
- Easy reference system for connecting related thoughts
- Ability to backtrack and explore new directions

## Notation System

### Structure
- Use heading levels (# ## ### ####) to indicate depth of reasoning
- Each node has a unique identifier in brackets [1.2.3]
- First number indicates the major branch
- Each subsequent number indicates a sub-branch
- Maximum recommended depth: 4 levels

### Status Markers
- ⟩ Currently active path being explored
- ○ Not yet explored
- ✓ Fully explored, yielded useful insights
- ✗ Explored but reached a dead end
- ⟳ Requires revisiting
- ⌥ Alternative approach identified

### Cross-References
- Reference other nodes using their identifiers: "This relates to [1.2.3]"
- Use "→" to indicate logical flow: "[1.1] → [1.2] → [1.2.1]"

   - Include brief notes about why paths were abandoned
   - Mark promising alternatives for future exploration

3. **Documentation Quality**
   - Include enough context to understand each node

4. **Navigation**
   - Maintain clear path tracking
   - Use consistent naming and numbering
   - Keep cross-references up to date

# Noise Protocol Investigation

## Handshake Message Flow Issue [1.0] ⟩
- Multiple test failures in noise_protocol_test.dart
- But handshake completes successfully in message size verification test
- Need to understand why some tests fail while basic handshake works

### Message Size Verification [1.1] ✓
1. First message (e):
   - Total message size: 34 bytes
   - Length prefix indicates: 32 bytes
   - Actual data size: 32 bytes
   - XXPattern expects: 32 bytes
   - Status: ✓ Verified working

2. Second message (e, ee, s, es):
   - Total message size: 82 bytes
   - Length prefix indicates: 80 bytes
   - Actual data size: 80 bytes
   - XXPattern expects: 80 bytes
   - Status: ✓ Verified working

3. Final message (s, se):
   - Total message size: 166 bytes
   - Length prefix indicates: 164 bytes
   - Actual data size: 164 bytes
   - XXPattern expects: 164 bytes
   - Status: ✓ Verified working

### Test Failure Analysis [1.2] ⟩

#### MAC Verification Failures [1.2.1] ⟩
Investigation results:

1. Message Structure Analysis:
   - Each encrypted message has:
     * 2-byte length prefix
     * Encrypted data
     * 16-byte MAC at the end
   - Total length in prefix includes both data and MAC
   - MAC verification happens during decryption

2. Failure Patterns:
   a. Identity Signature Test:
      - Handshake completes successfully
      - MAC verification succeeds for handshake
      - Failure occurs during identity verification
      - Suggests timing issue between handshake and identity verification

   b. Connection Closure Test:
      - Initial data transfer succeeds
      - MAC verification works for first message
      - Fails after connection closure
      - Points to connection state not being properly handled

   c. Invalid/Replayed Signatures:
      - MAC verification fails during handshake
      - Suggests nonce reuse or key derivation issues
      - Could be related to state management

3. Key Findings:
   - MAC verification works in basic handshake
   - Failures occur in specific scenarios:
     * After connection state changes
     * During identity verification
     * When replaying messages
   - Points to state management issue rather than MAC calculation

4. Key Derivation Analysis:
   a. Initial Setup:
      - Chain key initialized with protocol name hash
      - Temporary symmetric keys used during handshake
      - Both parties start with same initial key state

   b. Key Evolution:
      - Chain key updated via HMAC-SHA256 after each DH
      - Final keys derived using two HMAC operations:
        * k1 = HMAC(chainKey, 0x01)
        * k2 = HMAC(chainKey, 0x02)
      - Key assignment based on role:
        * Initiator: k1->send, k2->recv
        * Responder: k1->recv, k2->send

   c. Critical Points:
      - Keys derived only after handshake completion
      - No key rotation after initial derivation
      - State transitions affect key availability
      - Nonces start from 0 for each new connection

5. Potential Issues:
   a. Key Derivation Timing:
      - Keys not available until state is XXHandshakeState.complete
      - Race condition possible between state change and key use
      - No atomic operation for state+key update

   b. Nonce Management:
      - Simple counter starting from 0
      - No synchronization mechanism
      - Could be reset by connection state changes

   c. State Dependencies:
      - Key access tied to state checks
      - Connection closure may invalidate keys
      - No explicit key invalidation on error

6. Next Investigation Steps:
   - Add logging to track key derivation timing
   - Test state transitions with key operations
   - Verify nonce handling across connection events

#### Protocol State Management [1.2.2] ○

2. Unexpected message sizes in error handling tests
3. Timing-related failures in corruption tests
Investigation needed:
