# Noise Protocol Handshake Analysis [1.0] ⟩
- MAC verification failing during handshake
- Messages appear to be truncated
- Need to verify message handling in each step

## Message Flow Testing [1.1] ✓
Tested each message in the handshake sequence:
- First message (e): 34 bytes total (2 length + 32 data)
- Second message (e,ee,s,es): Should be 82 bytes (2 length + 80 data)
- Final message (s,se): Should be 166 bytes (2 length + 164 data)

### First Message Issues [1.1.1] ✓
- Message sent correctly (34 bytes)
- Fails with "No element" when reading response
- Indicates connection/stream issue, not message format problem

### Second Message Issues [1.1.2] ✓
- Error: "Message too short to contain encrypted static key"
- Occurs in xx_pattern.dart line 319
- Receiving 32 bytes when expecting 80
- Points to message truncation during reading

### Final Message Issues [1.1.3] ✓
- Error: "Message too short to contain MAC"
- Occurs in xx_pattern.dart line 345
- Receiving 32 bytes when expecting at least 48
- Consistent pattern of message truncation

## Message Reading Investigation [1.2] ✓
Key observations about message reading:
- Messages are length-prefixed (2 bytes)
- Each read operation gets correct length prefix
- But subsequent read gets truncated to 32 bytes
- Pattern suggests issue in read logic

### MockConnection Verification [1.2.1] ✓
- Tested basic read/write operations
- Length-prefixed messages work correctly
- No evidence of double buffering
- Buffer management functioning as expected

### Pattern Read Logic [1.2.2] ✓
Found the issue:
- NoiseProtocol._readHandshakeMessage correctly reads length prefix
- But XXPattern.readMessage assumes raw message without length prefix
- This mismatch causes message truncation
- Explains consistent 32-byte truncation pattern

## Solution Path [1.3] ⟩
1. NoiseProtocol is correctly handling length prefixes
2. XXPattern is correctly validating message sizes
3. The issue is in the interface between them:
   - NoiseProtocol removes length prefix before passing to XXPattern
   - But XXPattern's size checks assume length prefix is still present
4. Need to update XXPattern's size checks to account for already-removed length prefix
